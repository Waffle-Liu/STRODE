# Stochastic Boundary Ordinary Differential Equation (STRODE)
This is the authors' official PyTorch implementation for STRODE. This repo contains code for experiments in the **ICML 2021** paper '[STRODE: Stochastic Boundary Ordinary Differential Equation]()'.

## Project Description

The precise timing of each item in real-world data streams can carry important information about the underlying dynamics.  However, most algorithms for time-series modeling, e.g., latent ordinary differential equation (ODE), fail to **infer timings (timestamps) directly from visual or audio inputs**, and still require a large amount of training data with timing annotations. Inspired by neuroscience perspectives on time perception, we generalize neural ODE in handling a special type of boundary value problem with random boundary times and propose a probabilistic ordinary differential equation (ODE), called Stochastic boundaRy ODE (STRODE). Extensive experiments show that STRODE successfully learns both the **timings (timestamps)** and the **dynamics** of time series data **without requiring any timing annotations during training**.

## How to run
### Environment
* Python 3.7
* PyTorch 1.7.1

### Running experiments

#### Toy Dataset

For training and evaluation on the toy dataset, run the following script:
```
cd toy
python run.py --dataset exp
```
where `--dataset` specifies the dataset used in the experiments. For more specifications of the experiments, see details in `config.py`.

#### Rotating MNIST Thumbnail 

For training and evaluation on the rotating MNIST thumbnail, run the following script:
```
cd rotatingMNIST
python run.py --model strode --dataset exp
```
where `--model` and `--dataset` specify the model and the dataset used in the experiments. For more specifications of the experiments, see details in `config.py`.

### Data

You can directly set `isLoad=False`(default) in `config.py` and run the script above and new datasets will be automatically generated. `./data/MNIST/` contains the processed MNIST dataset. You can refer to `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` for details.
